# Twitter Crypto bot
This was my first programming project staretd in January of 2018. I learned Node JS in order to take advantage of individuals on Twitter telling people what to buy. At the time of use, I was looking at METIS_AI and John McAfee.

The project utilizes the Binance, Bittrex and Twitter APIs
